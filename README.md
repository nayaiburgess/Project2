# Project2

Showlink is an application tailored to Models and Agencies. Models are able to scroll through a plethora of fashion show events created by the agencies. They are able to create an account and view the details of each event. They are also able to connect with and view the tons of models and agencies who have signed up as well. As an agency, you are able to create an event, edit your event and also delete your event. As a model should NOT be able to create, edit, or delete an event.
